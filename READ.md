I was trying to come up with a way to  reduce the code for restful endpoints that produce similar pojo (marshallized pojos).
I really like rxJava, and it's really helped me to reduce my code.  I like the eventBus because it decouples my code, and allows me to treat each event like a request. So I created this project.

Endpoint: /v1/dog/id
